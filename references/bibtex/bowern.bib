    note = {Documentation of Indigenous languages has typically focussed on structural properties of languages (phonology, morphology and syntax). Comparatively little attention has been given to the documentation of language functions or to the documentation of the most commonly occurring speech formulas. Speech formulas are often culturally-specific and idiomatic and cannot be reliably reconstituted from a knowledge of grammar and lexicon alone. Many linguists and lexicographers seem to have an implicit relic view of language. It is as if linguists have been trying to capture the `pure', `unadulterated' language uncontaminated by language and culture contact. Accordingly, borrowed terms and neologisms are typically omitted or under-represented in their dictionaries and wordlists. Recorded texts have tended to be myths, Dreaming narratives or texts about traditional culture, though a number of contact history stories have also been admitted. Conversations, except in the context of the former are grossly under-represented, as are texts about everyday life, especially in non-traditional contexts (such as a medical consultation with an Aboriginal Health Worker). Just how useful are many language descriptions to their owners/custodians who may one day wish to revitalise them on the basis of these recordings and analyses? How can we ensure that they are maximally useful, not only to linguists but to the people most closely associated with the languages? The author will put forward some suggestions that researchers might bear in mind for future generations when documenting and conserving languages. These include working in a programmed fashion in a range of situations and contexts and in collaboration with a range of experts in specialised fields (such as health, law, botany etc). Considerable time will be needed to produce a maximally useful description of the language and its uses. Many of these suggestions emerge from first-hand experience working with Yolngu and Pintupi people in non-traditional domains as well as from attempts to reclaim and re-introduce the Kaurna language on the basis of written 19th century documentation of the language by missionaries (notably Teichelmann & Schürmann, 1840; Teichelmann, 1857) and other observers (see Amery, 2000).},

    abstract = {<p>Northern Paamese and Southeast Ambrym, two languages of Central Vanuatu, share a set of sound changes involving vocalization and loss of *l. One subpart of this sound change results in loss of *l word-initially before non-high vowels. An interesting aspect of this sound change is that it appears to apply in all word classes except verbs. Indeed, Crowley (1997) suggests that Northern Paamese *l-loss is a clear case of sound change with grammatical conditioning. In this paper we suggest that phonological and morphological aspects of verbal inflectional paradigms have given rise to the apparent exceptionality of *l-loss in these two languages. Phonological factors result in continuation of *l, while the structure of inflectional paradigms has given rise to analogical restoration of initial /l/ in all verbs where it is expected to be lost. Under this analysis, initial *l-loss can be seen to have applied without exception, and without grammatical conditioning.},

    abstract = {This study explores sound-symbolic, or mimetic, words in the Japanese language, the majority of which are never entered in Japanese dictionaries, and which may not be fully understood in all their nuances by native speakers. The extensiveness of the sound-symbolic system is related to the semantic under-differentiation of Japanese verbs. An introductory chapter states the problem, gives an overview of the study of sound symbolism, delineates the language corpus used, discusses linguistic varieties in Japanese, and explains terminology, transcription, and data sources used. An overview of the Japanese sound-symbolic system follows, focusing on the syntactic, prosodic, melodic, and phonological properties of mimetic forms. The third and fourth chapters look in greater detail at the sound symbolism of mimetic adverbs based on two root types. Chapter five explores some historical considerations related to the phonology of mimetic words. A final chapter discusses iconicity and linguistic structure and draws conclusions from the previous discussion. Contains 86 references. (MSE)},

    abstract = {<p><br/>Natural language are characterized by their unplanned purposefulness. They come into existence and change by an interaction of variation and selection. Their genuine mode of explanation is the invisible-hand explanation. It mirrors the three essential features of language: (1) Language is a dynamic process, (2) it consists of a micro and macro level, and (3) it shares certain characteristics as well as with natural phenomena. An invisible-hand theory explains the explanandum as the casual cumulative consequence of intentional actions. It is functional, reductional and individualistic. Every theory of linguistic change that claims to have explanatory force will be an invisible-hand theory.</p>},

While guidelines for creating effective new brand names have been proposed (e. g. the name should be distinctive, easy to pronounce, meaningful, etc), results of following such prescriptions are largely unknown. The purpose of this study is to examine customer response to products introduced with "meaningful" new brand names. Specifically, this research proposes and empirically tests two methods for creating meaningful new brand names. Results of the study indicate that products with brand names using sound symbolism to convey product-related information are liked better by consumers and positioned more strongly in their minds. Supplementing sound symbolism imbeds with semantic imbeds in a brand name further enhances both product liking and positioning.},

Interlingual comparison reveals phonetic consistencies between diminutive shifts of the languages for which information on sound symbolism is available. Increased hardness of articulation and higher pitch constitute the phonetic bases of diminutive shifting. Markedness and the form of the phonemic system are less important than phonetic criteria in determining shift types. In spite of gaps in the available data, some observations can be made concerning areal distribution and historical implications of shift types.},

    abstract = {The proposal that linguistic sounds such as phonemes, features, syllables, or tones can be meaningful, or sound-symbolic, contradicts the principles of arbitrariness and double articulation that are axiomatic to structural linguistics. Nevertheless, a considerable body of research that supports principles of sound symbolism has accumulated. This review discusses the most widely attested forms of sound symbolism and the research programs linked to sound symbolism that have influenced linguists and anthropologists most. Numerous reports of magnitude sound symbolism in the form of experimental studies and comparative surveys have been integrated into a biologically based theory of its motivation. Magnitude sound symbolism also catalyzed a number of experimental studies by psychologists and linguists in search of a universal sound-symbolic substrate underlying all languages. Although the search for a sound-symbolic substrate has been abandoned, the success rates of these studies have never been satisfactorily explained. Sound-symbolic processes have had a definitive impact on morphological analyses of phonesthemes and on historical linguists' understandings of diachronic processes. A typologically widespread form of sound symbolism occurs as a kind of lexical class known as the ideophone, which is conspicuously underdeveloped in standard average European languages, and highly perplexing for linguists and anthropologists. Although it has always been a respectable domain of inquiry in ethnopoetics and interpretive ethnography, the case for sound symbolism has of late been argued with renewed vigor on the part of psychological anthropologists and philosophers who see a paradigm shift under way.},

The evidence-all widely shared Post-PA features-is examined point by point, and it is argued that the nonambiguous features all point to diffusion. Countless flaws are found in Goddard's PEA Hypothesis, and the innovations claimed for it are shown to be retentions from PA and features diffused in the MAA or LE areas.},

Evidence is presented for a universal sound symbolism in a constellation of words in natural languages relating to proximity and distance. The discussion ranges from words relating to physical distance to terms of temporal and personal distance. Several explanations for the appearance of sound symbolism in this domain are suggested, including one based on their attributes as " shifters " or " indexical symbols ".},
