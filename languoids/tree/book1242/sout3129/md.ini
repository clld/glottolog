[hh_ethnologue_comment]
comment = E16/E17/E18/E19 lists Southern Lolopo [ysp] as a separate Central Yi language in
	the Jingdong, Jinggu, Lancang, Zhenyuan,
	Simao and Pu'er counties of Yunnan province, China. The (rather vague) location
	and classification matches the locations (and classification) described for
	Lolopo [ycl] and Miqie [yiq] in other sources (**hh:hb:Matisoff:Tibeto-Burman**,
	**hh:hel:Bradley:EAsia**,
	**hh:hv:Bradley:Tibeto-Burman**:104) and the Southern Lolopo
	[ysp] entry is quite possibly a confusion. See also: Miqie [yiq], Lolopo [ycl].
