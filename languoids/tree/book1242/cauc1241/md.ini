[hh_ethnologue_comment]
comment = Cauca [cca] is listed in E16/E17/E18/E19 as an extinct Chocoan language of
	Colombia.
	No location is given but from the name it may be inferred it is supposed to have
	been spoken in the Cauca river valley. There is no attested language in the
	Cauca valley not already counted in other entries in E16/E17/E18/E19
	(**hh:hv:Loukotka:SAmerica**:246-249, 255-258) except Quimbaya which is attested
	in about 10 words. But there are doubts as to whether 8 of these two words are
	really attributable to the language of the Quimbaya ethnic group
	(**hh:hv:Adelaar:Andes**:57).
	In any case, there is too little data to assert that the Quimbaya spoke a
	language different from all its neighbours.
