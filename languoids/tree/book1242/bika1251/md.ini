[hh_ethnologue_comment]
comment = Bikaru [bic] is listed in E16/E17/E18/E19 as a separate Sepik Hill language
	deriving from the Bikaru vocabulary collected by Bragge
	(**hh:hvw:ConradLewis:USepik**, **hh:w:Laycock:D28**) which shows a mix of
	Bisorio [blr] and Sanio [sny] resemblant words. Other attestations of
	Bikaru/Pikaru simply reflect a variety of Bisorio [bir]
	(**hh:hvw:ConradLewis:USepik**). Given that Bragge's vocabulary was collected
	monolingually on a survey, quite likely it reflects a confused elicitation
	session rather than a separate language. See also: Saniyo-Hiyewe [sny].
