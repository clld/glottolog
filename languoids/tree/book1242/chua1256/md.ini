[hh_ethnologue_comment]
comment = The entry Chuanqiandian Cluster Miao [cqd] entry subsumes varieties already
	included in E16/E17/E18/E19 under different entries
	(**hh:hvb:Niederer:Hmong-Mjen**). As a macro-language the [cqd] makes sense, but
	not as a distinct language in addition to the Miao languages already having
	entries.
