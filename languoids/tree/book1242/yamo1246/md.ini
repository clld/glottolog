[hh_ethnologue_comment]
comment = E16/E17/E18/E19 has an entry Yamongeri [ymg] which does not appear in the
	E16/E17/E18/E19 maps. Its location is specified only as ``Equateur province:
	south of Congo river'', but this and the name is sufficient to locate the group
	(**hh:hv:HackettvanBulck:ETeam**:72). This group speaks a variety of Mongo [lol]
	(**hh:g:Hulstaert:Dialectologie-Mongo**) and indeed the E16/E17/E18/E19 maps
	mark the territory where it is spoken as Mongo [lol]. See also: Mongo [lol].
