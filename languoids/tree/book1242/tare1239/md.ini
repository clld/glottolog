[hh_ethnologue_comment]
comment = E16/E17/E18/E19 has an entry Tareng [tgr] as a separate Katuic language of Laos,
	noting that it must be different from Talieng
	[tdf], located to the northwest, because Talieng [tdf] is Bahnaric. The Tareng
	[tgr] entry presumably derives from
	(**hh:h:WurmHattori:Pacific**:35) where it is indeed listed as Katuic. But there
	is only one (geographically discontinuous)
	language in Laos matching the geographic and other data in the two Tareng [tgr]
	and Talieng [tdf] entries
	(**hh:v:L-Thongkum:13-Mon-Khmer**:104-105,
	**hh:he:Schliesinger:Austro-Asiatic**:47-49) and this language is Bahnaric
	(**hh:v:L-Thongkum:13-Mon-Khmer**:104-105,
	cf.~**hh:hv:Sidwell:Austroasiatic:2015**:185), not Katuic. Presumably the
	existence of two entries rather than one comes from the Katuic/Bahnaric
	confusion. The Stieng [stg] entry of Vietnam may also represent the same
	language, though there is insufficient data available to me to validate one
	claim or the other
	(**hh:hv:Sidwell:Austroasiatic**:83,
	**hh:he:Schliesinger:Austro-Asiatic**:47-49). See also: Trieng [stg], Talieng
	[tdf].
