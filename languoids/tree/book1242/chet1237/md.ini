[hh_ethnologue_comment]
comment = E16/E17/E18/E19 has two entries Chetco [ctc] and Tolowa [tol]
	following earlier listings. Thanks to the work of
	**hh:s:Bommelyn:Tolowa** we now know that the two are indistinguishable as
	languages, making one of the entries spurious. See also: Tolowa-Chetco [tol].
