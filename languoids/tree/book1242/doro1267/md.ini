[hh_ethnologue_comment]
comment = The data on Kazukuru, an extinct language of New Georgia attested in wordlists,
	shows no more variation than expected if it was only one language (rather than
	three). Therefore, having three entries as in E16/E17/E18/E19 Dororo [drr],
	Guliguli [gli] and Kazukuru [kzk]
	overproduces two entries (**hh:hv:DunnRoss:Kazukuru**). See also: Kazukuru
	[kzk].
