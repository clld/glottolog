[hh_ethnologue_comment]
comment = E16/E17/E18/E19 has three entries Northwestern Tamang [tmk],
	Southwestern Tamang [tsf] and Western Tamang [tdg], while E16/E17/E18/E19
	retains two of them, removing Southwestern Tamang [tsf]. The Western Tamang
	entry, according to its description, subsumes both NW and SW and indicates that
	they are close enough to be mutually intelligible
	(as do all other descriptions of the Tamang dialect situation, e.g.,
	**hh:e:Hofer:WTamang**, **hh:hv:Honda:Tamangic**, **hh:s:Mazaudon:Tamang**,
	**hh:wsoc:Lipp:Western-Tamang**),
	so the NW and SW Tamang entries are spurious. A similar conclusion is reached
	for the areas covered by the survey of
	**hh:wsoc:Lipp:Western-Tamang**. See also: Southwestern Tamang [tsf], Western
	Tamang [tdg].
