[hh_ethnologue_comment]
comment = E16/E17/E18/E19/E20/E21/E22/E23 has three entries Northwestern Tamang [tmk],
	Southwestern Tamang [tsf] and Western Tamang [tdg], while E16/E17/E18/E19/E20/E21/E22/E23 retains two of them, removing Southwestern Tamang [tsf]. The Western Tamang entry, according to its description, subsumes both NW and SW and indicates that they are close enough to be mutually intelligible
	(as do all other descriptions of the Tamang dialect situation, e.g.,
	**hh:e:Hofer:WTamang**, **hh:hv:Honda:Tamangic**, **hh:s:Mazaudon:Tamang**, **hh:wsoc:Lipp:Western-Tamang**),
	so the NW and SW Tamang entries are spurious. A similar conclusion is reached for the areas covered by the survey of
	**hh:wsoc:Lipp:Western-Tamang**. See also: Western Tamang [tdg], Southwestern Tamang [tsf].
