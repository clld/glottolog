[hh_ethnologue_comment]
comment = Laos Sign Language [lso] is listed in E16/E17/E18/E19 as a separate language
	without any information except its name and the country of Laos. There are two
	known sign languages in Laos: 1) Original Laos Sign Language which is close to
	Original Chiang Mai Sign Language (Chiangmai Sign Language [csd]) and 2)
	(modern) Laos Sign Language which is close to essentially Thai Sign Language
	[tsq] (p.c. James Woodward). See also: Chiangmai Sign Language [csd], Thai Sign
	Language [tsq].
