[hh_ethnologue_comment]
comment = Quetzaltepec Mixe [pxm] is given its own entry, but no positive evidence exists
	that this is not intelligible with other Midland Mixe varieties. While some
	distinctiveness as to this variety may be expected, it is arbitrary to pick this
	town over others in the area with the same expectation. In this sense the entry
	is spurious
	(p.c.~SÃ¸ren Wichmann 2011).
