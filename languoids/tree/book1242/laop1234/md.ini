[hh_ethnologue_comment]
comment = E16/E17/E18/E19 has an entry Laopang [lbg] as an unclassified Loloish/Ngwi
	language of Myanmar (E16/E17/E18/E19)/Laos (E16/E17/E18/E19) with the alternate
	name Laopa. There appears to be only one language in the literature that can
	match these characteristics, namely Xa-Pho of
	**hh:he:Abadie:Haut-Tonkin**:185-186 who testifies they call themselves Lao-pa.
	However, this language already has an entry in E16/E17/E18/E19 as Laghuu [lgh]
	(cf.~**hh:phon:EdmondsonZiwo:Laghuu**). See also: Laghuu [lgh].
