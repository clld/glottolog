[hh_ethnologue_comment]
comment = E16/E17/E18 lists four entries for variaties of the dialect complex also known
	as Lua'/Mal/T'in/Pray (on the Border of Thailand and Laos) classified as
	follows:
	
	* Mal-Phrai (3)
	* Lua' [prb]
	* Mal [mlf]
	* Pray 3 [pry]
	* Mal-Prai (1)
	* Prai [prt]
	
	They are given overlapping names, speaker numbers, classification and locations
	on map, in a way that cannot be reconciled with detailed surveys of the Mal-Prai
	area (**hh:hv:Filbeck:Tin**, **hh:socdial:DillerDiller:Prai**,
	**hh:hv:Rischel:Mlabri-Mon-Khmer**). We suggest removing Pray 3 [pry], which is
	the entry whose location is the least well-defined and whose existence it least
	motivated by detailed surveys (**hh:hv:Filbeck:Tin**,
	**hh:socdial:DillerDiller:Prai**, **hh:hv:Rischel:Mlabri-Mon-Khmer**).
	See also: Prai [prt], Mal [mlf], Lua' [prb].
