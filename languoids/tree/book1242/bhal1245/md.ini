[hh_ethnologue_comment]
comment = Bhalay [bhx] is listed in E16/E17/E18/E19 as a separate language. However,
	Bhalay is a caste rather than an ethnic group with a particular language,
	and if they speak a language separate from their neighbours, it is Nimadi [noe]
	(**hh:e:RussellHiralal:Balahi**:106), which already has an E16/E17/E18/E19
	entry. See also: Nimadi [noe].
