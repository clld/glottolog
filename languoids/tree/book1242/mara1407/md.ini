[hh_ethnologue_comment]
comment = Maramba [myd] is listed in E16/E17/E18/E19 as a separate entry presumably
	following
	**hh:hv:Wurm:PapuanOceania** where it first occurs as a separate language.
	Earlier surveys have Maramba as an Angoram [aog] speaking village
	(**hh:hv:Laycock:Sepik**). The reason Maramba appeared as a separate language in
	**hh:hv:Wurm:PapuanOceania** is as follows.
	William Foley was told by Angoram speakers in 1977 that the language of Maramba
	was different from their own language and reported this to Donald Laycock who,
	in turn, passed it on to Stephen Wurm. On later trips by William Foley, other
	Angoram speakers have claimed that the Maramba village does speak their
	language. Unfortunately no researcher has studied the language(s?) at Maramba so
	we do not know what the situation actually is, but so far, there is no
	insufficient information to assert that there is a separate language at Maramba.
