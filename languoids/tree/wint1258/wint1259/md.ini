comment = Modern scholars of Wintuan languages are in agreement that Wintu, Nomlaki and
	Patwin are three separate languages. The most thorough discussion of the
	language and dialect situation in all three of the Wintuan languages is in
	Whistler's (1980) dissertation (pp. 15– 30, 46–53). Shepherd's (2005) book on
	Proto-Wintuan also distinguishes these three languages (see esp. pp. 1–4). Other
	more general works in agreement are: Golla (2011, 140–147), Mithun (1999,
	560–563), and Campbell (1997, 128). The discussion in Golla (2011) of the
	dialect continuum between Wintu and Nomlaki should by no means rule out their
	being recognized as two distinct languages. Dialect continuums are not uncommon
	in geographically adjacent languages which are closely related. Authors of
	ethnographies, grammars, dictionaries and collections of texts are careful to
	distinguish the three groups both ethnographically and linguistically: cf. for
	Patwin, Kroeber (1932) and Whistler (1977, 1978); for Nomlaki, Goldschmidt
	(1951); and for Wintu, Shepherd (1989), Pitkin (1984, 1985), and Schlichter
	(1981).
