[hh_ethnologue_comment]
comment = The /=Hoan language of Botswana was discovered by Anthony Traill in the early
	1970s
	(**hh:w:Traill:N4orS7**, **hh:hv:Traill:Koon**) and has recently been shown
	(**hh:hv:HeineHonken:Kxa**) to be related to the Ju-dialect cluster
	(also known as North Khoisan). ISO 693-3 has a /=Hua [huc]
	entry which has information (e.g., speaker number, grammatical characteristics)
	that matches the /=Hoan language as well as information (e.g., the
	classification, the name) that matches
	(**hh:typdial:Naumann:Taa**) a far eastern variety of the Taa dialect chain
	which is not intelligible with the westernmost end of that chain
	(represented in ISO 693-3 as !Xóõ [nmn]). The present-day location of both
	languages is the same (**hh:soc:GerlachBerthold:Hoan**) which might have lead to
	the confusion. Two entries are needed, one for the eastern dialect of Taa and
	one for the (entirely different)
	/=Hoan language, but ISO 693-3 has a merged entry, so one is missing from ISO
	693-3 (and the merged entry should be corrected accordingly). See also: East Taa
	[nmn].
