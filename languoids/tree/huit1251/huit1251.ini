	Classification comment: Aschmann 1993 clearly demonstrates the internal unity of Boran and Huitotoan respectively, on the grounds of shared basic lexicon (including pronouns). The Boran to Huitotoan comparisons, however, show irregular correspondences Fagua and Seifart 2010, Seifart and Echeverri 2010 and are therefore premature.
