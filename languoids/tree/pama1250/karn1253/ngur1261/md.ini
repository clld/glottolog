comment = There are 11 dialects listed under the existing Ngura nbx code. Dr. Bowern
	suggests they be understood as follows:
	
	Dr. Bowern supports the theory proposed that "Wurm and Hattori (1981) list the
	dialects as separate languages", as cited in the ethnologue entry for Ngura, as
	far as these four listed varieties go. Dr. Bowern suggests that Punthamara,
	Garlali, Wangkumara, Badjiri, and Eastern Karnic be listed as separate languages
	under a Ngura macrolanguage with the existing nbx code (if the nbx code must be
	retired, please list all these under the Ngura sub-family 190-16 since nbx will
	effectively be redundant).
	
	The remaining dialects under the existing nbx code--Bidjara, Mambangura,
	Mingbari, Ngurawarla, Yarumarra--should be listed as dialects of a new code,
	Eastern Karnic.
	
	Note Dhiraila and Karendala (Garandala) are NOT dialects in any sense, they
	should be listed as alternate names of Eastern Karnic.
	
	We believe that Dr. Bowern's research and expertise on languages of Australia,
	as well as the support of the sources listed below are sufficient to define
	these as distinct languages.
