comment = Dr. Bowern supports the judgement by Patrick McConvell that treats Karranga as a
	separate language (see http://wold.livingsources.org/language/182).
	
	We believe that Dr. Bowern's research and expertise on languages of Australia,
	as well as the support of the sources listed below are sufficient to define this
	as a distinct language.
