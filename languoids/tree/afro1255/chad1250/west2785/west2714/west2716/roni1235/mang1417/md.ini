comment = Mangar, a Chadic language of the Ron group, is clearly different enough from
	Daffo-Butura (and other Ron languages) to be a separate language
	(**hh:hv:Blench:Ron**) and is duly listed as a separate language in informed
	reference works (**hh:h:Jungraithmayr:Tchadiques**). It is missing from
	E16/E17/E18/E19.
