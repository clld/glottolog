	In terms of Arabic dialectology they have retained features by which they can be related to Mesopotamian (Iraqi) dialects prior to the so-called qeltu/gelet split and thus to the immigrations during the ninth and tenth centuries (Dahlgren 2002-03;2005) based on the criteria that were established for Central Asian Arabic by O. Jastrow (1998).
