comment = Canonical source(s): Evans 2006, Evans 1996
	Classification comment: The evidence for including Marrku in Iwaidjan is not sufficient as the similarities may well be due to borrowing Evans 2006. The very poorly attested Wurrugu has lexical correspondences with Marrku rather than the rest of Iwaidjan Evans 1996.
