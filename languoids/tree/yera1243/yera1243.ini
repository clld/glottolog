comment = Canonical source(s): Conrad and Dye 1975:14
	Classification comment: Yerakai shares no significant lexical relations with any Sepik language Conrad and Dye 1975:14, except Ndu Laycock 1973:23, but these are arguably loans from the adjacent Iatmul (as of intermarriage) Conrad and Dye 1975:14. No other argument for a Sepik affiliation in offered Laycock and ZGraggen 1975:738 and Yerakai is not mentioned in Foleys re-consideration of the Sepik family Foley 2005.
