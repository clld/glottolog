comment = Interesting well-analysed parallels between Haida, Eyak-Athapaskan and Tlingit have surfaced recently Enrico 2004 but do not fit sound correspondences with AET Leer 2010 and is not enough to conclude a genetic relationship. Similarly, the links to Yeniseic Vajda 2010 is not yet mature enough to conclude a genetic relationship Campbell 2011.
