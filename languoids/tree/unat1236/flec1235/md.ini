[hh_ethnologue_comment]
comment = The Flecheiros is one of the uncontacted peoples in the Javari region
	(**hh:he:Ricardo:Javari**). If anything, Ethnographic considerations would point
	to the language being Kanamarí [knm]. But since
	**hh:e:Wallace:Unconquered** recounts one meeting between a Kanamarí [knm] and
	the Flecheiros, showing that the two have different languages, they arguably
	speak a language not counted already in E16/E17/E18/E19. See also:
	Katukína-Kanamarí [knm].
