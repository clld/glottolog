[hh_ethnologue_comment]
comment = Kontan치wa (Panoan, thought to be extinct until 2002) is missing from
	E16/E17/E18/E19 **hh:hsoc:deAguiar:Panoan**:40. However, no linguistic data has
	been published to contradict or verify that Kontan치wa is a different language
	(as opposed to merely a dialect of a different ethnic group, or a different
	ethnic group who no longer speak their ancestral language) from other
	Nawa-languages (**hh:hsoc:deAguiar:Panoan**, **hh:he:Tastevin:Jurua**). If not a
	distinct language, Kontan치wa should at least be included as a dialect of another
	language.
