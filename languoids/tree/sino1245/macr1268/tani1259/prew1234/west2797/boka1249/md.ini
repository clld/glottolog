[hh_ethnologue_comment]
comment = Bokar, a Tibeto-Burman language of the Western Tani subgroup, is missing as a
	distinct language (**hh:s:Megu:Bokar**, **hh:hew:Grewal:Arunachal**,
	**hh:s:Ouyang:Luoba**). Bokar occurs under the entry Adi [adi] along with a
	number of Western and Eastern Tani lects. Bokar should be taken out of ``Adi''
	since it is far too divergent from both the other Western and Eastern Tani
	languages (**hh:hv:Sun:Tani**). See also: Bori-Karko [adi].
