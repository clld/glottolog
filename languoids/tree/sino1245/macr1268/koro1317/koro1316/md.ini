[hh_ethnologue_comment]
comment = The Koro-Aka language (**hh:w:Anderson:Koro-Aka**), a Siangic language of Arunachal Pradesh, is missing from E16. (The Hruso [hru] entry mentions Koro (as Aka) with the incoherent claim that it is a
	'dialect' that shares 9% of its vocabulary with Hruso [hru]. This information is presumably a misinterpretation of the unpublished 2005
	survey (**hh:hwsoc:Abrahametal:WArunachal**), which correctly identified Aka as a separate language and contains a vocabulary and the lexicostatistical comparison with the 9% figure.)  This is the language arrogantly purported to be a ``newly discovered'' language by National Geographic's "Enduring Voices" project and picked up by many major news outlets, e.g., BBC (5 October 2010: ``Indian language is new to science'' by Daniel Boettcher
	<http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-11479563> accessed
	20 October 2010). In fact, language data on Koro (as Pichang) was published by **hh:hld:Barthakur:Kameng**:22-26 and (as Miri-Aka) by
	**hh:hew:Grewal:Aka-Miji**, **hh:hew:Grewal:Arunachal** and the existence of the language (as a separate language) has been mentioned (without data) in publications several times earlier, e.g.,
	**hh:e:Sinha:Akas**:13-15. See also: Hruso [hru].
