[hh_ethnologue_comment]
comment = The Bangru language, a close relative of Miji [sjl], is missing
	(**hh:hv:Sun:Tani**:159, **hh:e:Ramya:Bangrus**,
	**hh:vw:Blench:Miji**).  Bangru and Levai (another name for Bangru) is listed in
	E16/E17/E18/E19 as a dialect of Hruso [hru], presumably because of the confused
	idea that Hruso [hru] is a dialect of Miji [sjl], going back to
	**hh:hv:Shafer:Hruso**. Miji and Hruso share some borrowed vocabulary but are
	otherwise vastly different,
	-- nowhere near being dialects -- and probably not even deep-level related
	(**hh:hvw:BlenchPost:Arunachal**). If anything, Bangru is a dialect of Miji, not
	of Hruso, and though the amount of data so far available is small,
	it suggests that Miji and Bangru are different enough not to be intelligible.
	See also: Hruso [hru], Sajalong [sjl].
