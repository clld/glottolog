comment = Canonical source(s): Schadeberg 1989
	Classification comment: Rashad is held together lexically and pronominally Stevenson 1956/1957:46-52. The noun class system cannot be shown conclusively to be original as there as no secure traces of a loss. The alleged noun class form/meaning correspondences to other Kordofanian groups, namely Talodi (with Tegem) and Heiban, in Schadeberg 1989, Schadeberg 1981 are not convincing as conclusively genetic; As to form, there is much eclectic selection as well as irregular correspondences, and as to meaning, the methodology of finding non-cognate shared class items is highly dubious. Chance resemblance has not been excluded. The lexical evidence for a Kordofanian unity is weak in the extreme Blench 2006. It follows that the arguments presented for a Niger-Congo affiliation are not compelling either.
