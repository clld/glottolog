	Classification comment: Typological arguments are not sufficient to conclude a Leonard Schultze family with Walio Laycock and ZGraggen 1975. The lexical evidence does not show any conclusive genetic relationship either, be it inside or outside Leonard Schultze Conrad and Dye 1975, or with Duranmin Conrad and Lewis 1988 (a higher figure (29%) of Papi-Duranmin lexicostatistical relations quoted by Laycock earlier, is superseded by the later, below 10%, figures of Conrad and Lewis).
