comment = Canonical source(s): Larson 1977
	Classification comment: The cognation judgments of Larson 1977 involving Dem are warped in that a match is judged if at least one segment matches. Needless to say, this gives inconsistent sound correspondences. The lexicostatistic argument for relatedness is the only one offered so far, and apart from probable borrowings, I cannot find cognate vocabulary or morphology.

[classification]
family = The cognation judgments involving Dem in **94763** are overly optimistic in that a match is judged if at least one segment matches. This procedure yields inconsistent sound correspondences. The lexicostatistic argument for relatedness is the only one offered so far, and apart from probable borrowings, we cannot find any cognates in vocabulary or morphology.
