	Classification comment: Typological arguments are not sufficient to conclude a Leonard Schultze family with Papi Laycock and ZGraggen 1975. The lexical evidence does not show any conclusive genetic relationship either, be it inside or outside Leonard Schultze Conrad and Dye 1975, Conrad and Lewis 1988.
