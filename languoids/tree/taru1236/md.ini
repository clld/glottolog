[hh_ethnologue_comment]
comment = Taruma, an isolated language of the Brazil/Guyana borderlands,
	is missing from E16/E17/E18. While often presumed extinct, there are three
	Taruma left, living among the Wapishana (**hh:hv:Carlin:Cariban-Mawayana**:315).
	One of the three is fluent enough to produce coherent texts in Taruma while the
	other two have a much weaker knowledge of the language (p.c.~Sergio Meira 2015).
