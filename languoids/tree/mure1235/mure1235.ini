comment = Canonical source(s): Teza 1868, de Crequi-Montfort and Rivet 1913
	Classification comment: The text analysis of Mure by de Crequi-Montfort and Rivet 1913 is sound, but the parallels with Chapacuran are limited to a few words, while the rest it utterly different. Therefore, the near-identical Chapacuran words are likely to be loans, especially given that the Mure were missioned together with Chapacuran peoples. No other relation for the Mure data has been suggested or is apparent.
