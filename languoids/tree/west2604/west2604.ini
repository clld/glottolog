	Classification comment: The inclusion of the poorly known Karas is best argued in Cowan 1953:33-36, with system correspondences in pronominals and a few items of basic vocabulary. Evidence for inclusion in Trans New Guinea is weak Voorhoeve 1975:432-437, both lexically and pronominally, cf.~Pawley 2005:94-95. Likewise, the East Timor/Alor comparisons in Hull 2004 are flimsy.
