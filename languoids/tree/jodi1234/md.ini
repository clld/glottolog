	**hh:v:Roses:Jodi-Saliban:2019**
family = **hh:v:Roses:Jodi-Saliban:2019** contains putative cognates arguably going back to proto-Saliban. Since many of them belong to basic vocabulary, a genealogical interpretation is somewhat more attractive than a contact explanation (argued by **hh:hv:Zamponi:Mid-Orinoco**) until a deeper investigation is conducted.
