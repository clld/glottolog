	Classification comment: Wurms arguments Wurm 1975:327-335 for a Trans New Guinea affiliation appear to be unreliable lexicostatistics and typological features. Likewise, the lexical and pronominal evidence for a Trans New Guinea affiliation is weak. See Fleischmann and Turpeinen 1976 for additional lexical data on the internal coherence of the group.
