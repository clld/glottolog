[hh_ethnologue_comment]
comment = Shanjo is a language of Zambia which appears as a dialect of Tonga (Zambia)
	[toi] in E16/E17/E18/E19. However, it turns out that Shanjo is not intelligible
	to Tonga and does not even subgroup with Tonga (**hh:hv:deLuna:Botatwe**,
	**hh:hv:Bostoen:Botatwe**, **hh:hvw:deLuna:Botatwe**) and thus merits an entry
	of its own. See also: Tonga (Zambia) [toi].
