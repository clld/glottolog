[hh_ethnologue_comment]
comment = E16/E17/E18/E19 has a separate entry for Mayeka [myc],
	a Bantu language of the Democratic Republic of the Congo. It is very likely to
	be the same as Ngbinda [nbd] since **hh:he:deCalonne:Ubangi-Uele-Aruwimi**:114,
	120, 247, 251 calls Mayeka a clan of Abangbinda, though no actual linguistic
	data is presented. The information on Mayeka [myc] in E16/E17/E18/E19 presumably
	derives from
	**hh:hv:HackettvanBulck:ETeam** who took down a Mayeka wordlist but were not
	able to find out the location of Mayeka, and did not have access to a Ngbinda
	wordlist (**hh:hsoc:vanBulck:Mission**:74-75) to check if Mayeka and Ngbinda
	were the same. Though, at the present time, if Hackett and van Bulck's
	unpublished Mayeka wordlist still exists in an archive somewhere, it should be
	checked whether the data is actually Ngbinda or a different, but related,
	language.
