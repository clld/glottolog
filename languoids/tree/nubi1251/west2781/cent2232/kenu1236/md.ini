comment = 1- Both language communities claim different idntities, however all Nile
	Nubians, i.e Nobiin speakers, Dongolawi speakers and Kenzi speakers, claim
	inheriting the former Nubian identity, heritage and civilization.
	
	2- The two languages are claimed, beside other dialects, as dialects of the Old
	Nubian language, but the difference between the two is to the level that, they
	can't be claimed or considered as one
	
	3- There is medium intelligibility between the speakers of the two languages,
	
	4- No common literature neither written nor traditional. Written texts in each
	language are availble separately.
	
	5-No any written text claimed or known as Kenuzi-Dongola,
	
	6-Native scholars from each group did and continue doing researches every in
	their own language, without any claims in the other language , i.e Kenzi
	scholars do researches in Kenzi/Kenuzi -Self name Mattokki, without mentioning
	Dongolawi. The Dongolawi scholars do researches in Dongolawi - Self name
	Andaandi, without mentioning Kenzi. This fact, also implies that the two are
	divergent to the level that, no native scholar claims them as one. Ultimately
	there is no language known by the name Kenuzi-Dongola among Kenzi natives as
	well as among Dongolawi natives.
	
	7- Developing writing system for each language is progressing on its own, by
	native scholars of each
