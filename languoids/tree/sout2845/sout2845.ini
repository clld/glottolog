	Classification comment: (South) Omotic does not show diagnostic Afro-Asiatic features Hayward 2004, Bender 2000, Bender 2003, Theil 2007, and is therefore excluded until such features can be shown. The Mao languages (Hozo, Seze, Bambeshi and Ganza) have not yet been shown to be (North or South) Omotic in morphology and/or core vocabulary, though there are some resemblances with North Omotic Bender 1975, Bender 1985, Bender 2000, Bender 1975. The evidence for the coherence of North and South Omotic (= Ari-Banna) Hayward and Tsuge 1998, Fleming 1992, Fleming and Lewis 1961, Fleming and Lewis 1963 is not sufficient Fleming 1993, Lamberti 1993, Zaborski 2007.
