comment = Canonical source(s): Trefry 1969
	Classification comment: Despite vocabulary cognacy of 5% or so, Pawaia was included in Trans-New-Guinea because of pronoun resemblances to Kuman and on typological  similarities. The typological similarities involve function only Trefry 1969, and thus count for nothing. The pronoun resemblances do not generalize to the Chimbu family Foley 1986:69-71 and match only an emphn anyway, so they are better accounted for as accidental similarities than deep relationship.
