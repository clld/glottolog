comment = The currently-existing "Bicolano, Albay" does not correspond to any of the
	accepted Bikol subgroupings, the most widely-recognized of which is McFarland
	(1974) which was also adopted by Zorc (1977). Jason Lobel, the supporter of this
	request, has also done extensive research on the languages of the Bikol region,
	and his findings largely support those of McFarland (1974) and likewise do not
	support a "Bicolano Albay" language that would include Buhi'non, Miraya, and
	Bikol Libon. Such a language is also not supported by the identities of the
	people of Albay province themselves. Therefore, it is requested that the
	"Bicolano Albay" entry be split into four entries, "Bikol West Albay", "Bikol
	Miraya", "Bikol, Libon", and "Bikol Buhi'non". (Note also that calling any of
	these languages "Bicolano" or "Bikolano" is a mistake because "Bikolano" is the
	name of the ethnic group while "Bikol" is the name of the languages.)
