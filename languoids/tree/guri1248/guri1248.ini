comment = Canonical source(s): Baron 1983
	Classification comment: Laycock never presented real evidence for a Kwomtari-Baibai-Pyu family Laycock 1975. It is clear from the data collected so far Baron 1983 that Guriaso [grx] shares no more lexical cognates with Kwomtari and Biaka than expected at random, and thats not even when borrowing is discounted (Kwomtari neighbours Guriaso). Further correspondences presented are merely typological or random enough to make Japanese a Kwomtari language Baron 1983:29.
