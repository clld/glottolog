	Classification comment: The Ndu languages do not show cognate pronouns or gender markers with Sepik Foley 2005:126-139, and there is there is detailed refutation of the evidence so far presented that Ndu is related to Kwoma-Kwanga (or the rest of Sepik) Aikhenvald 2008. Yerakai shares no significant lexical relations with any Sepik language Conrad and Dye 1975:14, except Ndu Laycock 1973:23, but these are arguably loans from the adjacent Iatmul (as of intermarriage) Conrad and Dye 1975:14.

[classification]
family = The Ndu languages do not show cognate gender markers with Sepik while the pronouns show some amount of resemblance **161751**:126-139. However, with the extant variety of pronoun forms with the Sepik languages, it is difficult to ascertain beyond-chance relationships. The best resemblance is with Kwoma but there is detailed refutation of the evidence so far presented that Ndu is related to Kwoma-Kwanga (or the rest of Sepik) **30214**. Yerakai shares no significant lexical relations with any Sepik language **109325**:14, except Ndu **108516**:23, but these are arguably loans from the adjacent Iatmul (as of intermarriage) **109325**:14 **28589**.
